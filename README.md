# HostedCortanaDemo
Integrating with Cortana on Windows 10 from a remote website.

## In Progress
This project is in progress. It currently supports the Cortana command "Cortana Demo send message" followed by any spoken phrase. The html is not complete to show the text being passed back from Cortana to the site but it can be seen in the console by hitting F12 when the Hosted App is running.

## Setup:
1. Clone or fork the repo
2. npm install
3. gulp appx:dev
